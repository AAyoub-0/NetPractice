# Description

The goal of this project is to configure configure small-scale networks and to understand tcp/ip adressesing as long as long as subnet mask and default geteway work.  

To do so we needed to complete 10 levels of small-scale networks that looks like this :

Then we need to download the json format for the correction.

# Instructions

This project doesn't contain any executable, the submission is the json files of the 10 levels and this README.md.

The peer-evaluation is done on the same website used to train the levels.

The training interface runs as so :

- First you open the index.html file from the project files
- Then you may enter your intranet login in "training" section and press "start" button
- Then for each level you have to modify the editable inputs so the networks works as the rules wants to
- When you are finished, you may press "Check again" to verify your work
- Finally when all is okay, you can press "Get my config" to download the json file that is expected

It's the same for the peer evaluation.
